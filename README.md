## üéØ What is Cassandra Probe?

Cassandra Probe is a standalone diagnostic tool that helps you:

- **Test Cassandra driver resilience** - Validate how your applications handle node failures and recoveries
- **Monitor cluster health** - Continuously probe your Cassandra nodes to detect issues early
- **Verify rolling restarts** - Ensure your maintenance procedures don't impact availability
- **Diagnose connectivity issues** - Identify network, authentication, or configuration problems
- **Validate failover scenarios** - Test your disaster recovery procedures

Unlike simple connectivity checkers, Cassandra Probe maintains persistent connections to simulate real application behavior, making it ideal for testing production scenarios.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Download

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/axonops/cassandra-probe-csharp/releases) page.

| Platform | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Windows | `cassandra-probe-*-win-x64.zip` | 64-bit Windows executable |
| Linux | `cassandra-probe-*-linux-x64.tar.gz` | 64-bit Linux executable |
| macOS Intel | `cassandra-probe-*-osx-x64.tar.gz` | Intel Mac executable |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `cassandra-probe-*-osx-arm64.tar.gz` | M1/M2/M3 Mac executable |

### Install and Run

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Extract
tar -xzf cassandra-probe-*.tar.gz

# Make executable
chmod +x cassandra-probe

# Run basic connectivity test
./cassandra-probe --contact-points localhost:9042
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Extract
Expand-Archive cassandra-probe-*.zip

# Run basic connectivity test
.\cassandra-probe.exe --contact-points localhost:9042
```

### Common Use Cases

```bash
# Test cluster with authentication
./cassandra-probe --contact-points node1:9042,node2:9042 -u cassandra -p cassandra

# Monitor cluster continuously (every 30 seconds)
./cassandra-probe --contact-points cluster:9042 -i 30 --connection-events

# Run all diagnostic probes
./cassandra-probe --contact-points cluster:9042 --all-probes

# Test specific CQL query
./cassandra-probe --contact-points cluster:9042 --test-cql "SELECT * FROM system.local"
```

## üìã Requirements

- **Apache Cassandra**: 4.0 or later (Cassandra 3.x is not supported)
- **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **Runtime**: None required (self-contained executable)

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Driver Reconnection Testing
The primary purpose of Cassandra Probe is to validate Cassandra driver behavior during failure scenarios:
- Maintains persistent connections across probe iterations
- Logs all reconnection events and attempts
- Simulates real application connection patterns
- Helps validate production failover behavior

### Comprehensive Diagnostics
- **Multiple probe types**: Socket, ping, CQL, port-specific tests
- **Cluster discovery**: Automatically finds all nodes in the topology
- **Detailed metrics**: Response times, error rates, success counts
- **Flexible output**: Console, JSON, CSV, or compact formats

### Production-Ready
- **Zero dependencies**: Single executable file
- **Cross-platform**: Native builds for all major platforms
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage
- **Configurable**: YAML configuration files supported

## üß™ Testing Driver Reconnection

One of the most valuable uses of Cassandra Probe is testing how your applications handle node failures:

```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
./cassandra-probe --contact-points cluster:9042 -i 5 --connection-events

# In another terminal, stop a Cassandra node
# Watch the probe output to see:
# - Connection failure detection
# - Reconnection attempts
# - Recovery time
# - Which nodes take over

# Restart the node and observe:
# - Reconnection success
# - Topology changes
# - Load rebalancing
```

This helps you understand:
- How quickly your drivers detect failures
- Whether reconnection policies work correctly
- If your application can maintain availability during maintenance
